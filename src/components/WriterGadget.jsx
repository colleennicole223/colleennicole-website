            <h1>Writer Gadget </h1>
            <p>Actively creating prototypes and high-fidelity visuals the front end of Writers Gadget â€“ 
              a responsive application designed to plan, organize, and track story ideas. Utilizing Figma
              to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for this functional application.</p>
            <h2>Prototyping</h2>
            <p>Wireframing allowed me to brainstorm a handful of designs and get feedback from the 
              developers and users of the application. This iterative process helped identify potential 
              issues and opportunities for improvement before investing in high-fidelity prototypes. The 
              challenge of this stage was finding ways to display information while maintaining a minimal 
              interface. Since the app is a creative tool designed to enhance users' thoughts - it was 
              crucial to ensure that the interface did not distract or hinder their creative process. 
              Striking this balance required careful consideration of both functionality and user experience
              to create an environment that enhancing writing rather than overwhelms. </p>

            <h2>High Fidelity Prototype</h2>
            <p>I am actively developing high-fidelity prototypes to provide a more realistic representation 
              of the final product and accurately display the flow through the application. I am in the early 
              stage of this process and am excited to share some of the revised user flow soon. Here are some
              sneak peeks of screens in development,</p>

            <p>There is much more to be done and I look forward to my ongoing collaboration with Writer Gadget. 
              Moving forward, the priority will be expanding and refining the high-fidelity prototypes in 
              preparation for a usability test with local writers. </p>
