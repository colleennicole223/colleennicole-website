            <h1>Writer Gadget </h1>
            <p>
            Actively creating prototypes and high-fidelity visuals on the front end of Writers Gadget â€“ a responsive application designed to plan, organize, and track story ideas. Utilizing <span className="highlight"> Figma </span>  to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for this functional application.
            </p>
            <h2>Prototyping</h2>
            <p>
            Conducted an iterative brainstorming process with the developers and users of the existing application. Identified upcoming features and drafted a user flow for the reworked application. 
            </p>
            <p>
            The challenge of this stage was finding ways to display information while maintaining a minimal interface. It was crucial to ensure that the interface did not distract or hinder the user's creative process.

            <h2>High Fidelity Prototype</h2>
            <p>
            Actively developing high-fidelity prototypes to provide a more realistic representation of the final product. I am in the early stage of this process and am excited to share some of the revised user flow soon. Here are some of the reworked pages next to the original application.

            <h2>Upcoming</h2>
            <p>
            There is much more to be done and I look forward to my ongoing collaboration with Writer Gadget. Moving forward, the priority will be expanding and refining the high-fidelity prototypes in preparation for a usability test with local writers.
